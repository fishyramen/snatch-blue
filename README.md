so, what is this? it was originally made by DeKrypted (shoutout to that guy) but it didnt work no more so I just fixed it back.

### SIMPLE STEPS TO GET IT TO WORK:
1. fork this
2. go in your discord server, go in the settings of a text channel, integrations, webhooks then make one. once you have made one click on it then u copy the webhook link.
3. go in main.py then change the webhook thingy to the one you just copied.
4. save everything then make an account in vercel then new project. import the one you forked from me then you're done i guess.
5. to try it just go in the website yourself and then ur info will appear in your own server (assuming you've done all the other steps).

if i didnt explain this well enough thats too bad i tried my best 😭
I just use this to troll my friends but I 100% AM NOT telling you guys to use this on your enemies or for malicious intent.
I am only showing this to people who actually want to learn about how this stuff works because I know there are people out there who want to learn how ip loggers work but don't know how.





dear github mods, please spare me, dont make my account on suspension like dekrypted i didnt do anything to u bro
